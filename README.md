#### Data sources
- **World geojson data** from (https://geojson-maps.ash.ms) and selected medium resolution and all regions, which resulted in '50m.geo.json'.
- **UK geojson data** from (https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html), imported 'gadm36_GBR_1.shp' and 'gadm36_GBR_1.dbf' files
into (http://mapshaper.org), used 'detect line intersections' and 'snap vertices' options, and simplified using 'Visvalingam / weighted area' method
to 0.08% to match the border details of the world geojson data. All of that resulted in 'gadm36_GBR_1.json'.
- **List of countries** that participated in the FIFA World Cup was gathered manually from Wikipedia. (Countries that qualified but withdrew were not used).

#### Modifications to the data
- I had to split up the United Kingdom because the countries of the United Kingdom compete separately in the FIFA World Cup.
- On the '50m.geo.json', I deleted the feature for the United Kingdom and added the features from 'gadm36_GBR_1.json', which represents
England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
- Lastly, I changed the name attribute for those four countries from 'NAME_1' to 'name' in order to match the name attribute for the other countries.

- On the '50m.geo.json', I changed the name of:
  "Korea" to "South Korea",
  "Dem. Rep. Korea" to "North Korea",
  "Bosnia and Herz." to "Bosnia and Herzegovina",
  "CÃ´te d'Ivoire" to "Ivory Coast"
  "Czech Rep." to "Czech Republic".

#### How I dealt with the "old countries"
- For the 2006 World Cup, Serbia and Montenegro are colored, separately, for Serbia and Montenegro.
- Until the 1994 World Cup, Yugoslavia includes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.
- For the 1994 World Cup, Yugoslavia includes Serbia and Montenegro.
- Soviet Union includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.
- Czechoslovakia includes Czech Republic and Slovakia.
- Germany is colored for both East Germany and West Germany.
- For the 1974 World Cup, Congo is colored for Zaire.
- For the 1938 World Cup, Indonesia is colored for Dutch East Indies.
